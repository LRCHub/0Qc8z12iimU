Let me take you to a place I know you wanna go
It's a good life
I wanna stand around and beg you
Just don't say no
No, no, no, no

I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it
What I'm doing to you
And I know what I'm doing
I'll be doing what you want to me to do, hey

Love is shining
Life is thriving
In the good life
Good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life
Good life

A feeling that you get from the good life, hey
Once you get that good life feeling
Let me tell you no one can take it away
No, no, no, no

Love is shining
Life is thriving
In the good life
Good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life
Good life

Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life
Good life

This song will make your day
Inner city, Paris grey
This song will make your day
Inner city, Paris grey

When the grooves are rocking
Nothing feels as good as a good life
I want you to want me
To want the good life all night

Love is shining
Life is thriving
In the good life
Good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life

Good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life
Good life

Come on, get down tonight
Good life
