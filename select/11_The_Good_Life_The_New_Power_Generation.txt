The good life - (Microphone check) Checkin' the mic 1-2
The good life - (Microphone check) Checkin' the mic 1-2
The good life - (Bought a house next 2 Prince) I'll
Be checkin' the mic 1-2
The good life - (Microphone check) N.P.G. on the mic 1-2

The good life one day I'll be livin'
Sick of the bullshit this life be givin'
Every single day harder than the last one
Keep my dollars, fuckin' hope they have a son
Then I'll be another million ahead of the game
Spoon full of sugar and a glass of fame
Checkin' young lions callin' me outta my name
Even Shaq know it anything but tame
We be, and there ain't no hooks (mind 2 mind) until we say so
Everybody's a slave until U say no
And take control of every 'hood (Got my ass in Minnesota)
And U'll be livin' the life and it'll be all good

The good gig, yeah, U know
We don't need 2 boast about the fact we put the "O" in show
Stadium here, there, we just got back from Glasgow
100, 000 nightly, still we ain't happy, oh no
Don't ask me why though
Open up that can of worms and several gonna cry, yo
But Nicey B. got my back now
But 'til she tell me otherwise, we kickin' down doors
Stupid motherfuckers need 2 know
This little nigga gotta flow
Slippier than a baby just out da ho'
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Sexophones and violins
Crack house bass be funkier than
20 cans of wet magic shave
I know U know we know how 2 rave
'Cause we be checkin' 4 the 5 and 6
A loop don't matter if the sample don't fit {x2}
A loop don't, loop don't, loop don't matter if the sample don't fit
Tell me now, what is hip?
(Example A:) A skinny black nigga on the bass?
(Example B:) Or somebody hoppin' around like they gettin'
Their ass whipped?
Here come the judge like Ito
And just like Aretha with a sack of Fritos
We funkin' 'til the kingdom come
Tito got your tissue son
Before this motherfucker's done
Somebody goin' down and it won't be this one (Not I)
Because we're here 2 have fun
It ain't about the money or the gun
We just wanna be free as the sun
Then we'll be all nice livin' that.
